# manfish-openServicePlatform
This is a local service open platform based on the FastAPI+Django framework (pure Python framework), which includes two servers and two clients. It mainly serves platform service providers, opening up local computing resources (such as AI or io computing services) to customers in the form of order responses and obtaining virtual revenue from it.
